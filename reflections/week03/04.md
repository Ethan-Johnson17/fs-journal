> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

It keeps the page updated and in synch with the various click based events going on.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

Subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

We add code that tracks the changes and that gets communicated from the proxystate to the DOM throught the controller. Without the observer pattern, it would get lost in the process.
