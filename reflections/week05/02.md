## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One to one, one to many, and many to many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

There are two real benefits, one is that the document is less likely to exceed the max file size and the second is that pagination is easier with linking

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

N:M relationships can be very complex, you have to determine if you can identify references that have fewer relationships, you have to consider the adding and removing of relationships.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Using an atual database made the gregslist project much easier than yesterday's fakedb. I love that we can also use a third party authentication system as well.
