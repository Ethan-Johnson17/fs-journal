## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We implemented the UX focus principles and oair programming. 

2. What went well this week?

I really like having someone to help navigate and catch errors as I typed. Tristan was helpful, it helped reserve some brain power throughout the day.

3. What would you do differently?

Towards the end of the week we were getting on each other's nerves. I would have changed my communication style. I should have spoke up if something was a hinderance to me.
