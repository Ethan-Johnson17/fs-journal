## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

It's like instructions for your code, whether it be how to's or why's. Common forms include READMEs, howto guides or documenation in the source.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

You can avoid forgetting or misinterpreting what type of information a poorly named variable is looking for. You'll also write better code so you don't have to document as much. 

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

It's really important. No matter how much a developer likes to think the code speaks for itself, it won't to someone else of a few months down the road. If you can't understand the code, it's worthless and needs to be replaced. It'll save time and effort to docement in the beginning.
