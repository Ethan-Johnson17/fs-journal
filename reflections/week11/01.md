## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

It allows us to use code we have written for multiple purposes within the same application while also being a tool to allow code to take on an identity of the code it inherits from.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

No, constructors are not inherited and must be declared. A class can only inherit from one other class but can inherit transistively. 

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

If a certain portion of code is marked private, it cannot be accessed by the child class unless it is invoked directly in the parent class.
