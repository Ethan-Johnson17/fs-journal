## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This course has been very eye-opening, and I think it's fair to say, life-changing. There were a few spots that I wondered if there might have been a better way to teach us but I usually ended up seeing why it was taught that way. C# has been my least favorite part, as it just seems overly complicated. The many to many relationships are way too complicated. All in all, it has been a positive experience and I would highly recommend this course to others.
