# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I have some experience with HTML and CSS, so this week wasn't too difficult. It still provided some challenge as I shook off some rust and learned bootstrap, but it was a lot of fun. Overall, it was a great experience. I'm nervous for the coming weeks and the challenges they'll bring as I learn completely new things, but it's an exciting prospect as well. If i enjoyed CSS and HTML, I know there's more fun to come.
