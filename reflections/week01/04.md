## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

They are a great way to create a simplified desgin to build a website off of and they ar a great way to plan a design with a client.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low fidelity is useful for a rough and distraction free mockup. They are often used mid meeting with clients.

Mid fidelity shows more detail but is still without images and other elements that will heavily draw attention. They are a good middle ground and can be used for showing to a customer.

High Fidelity shows images, typography, and other details. They are used to show what a final product will look like.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Yes, by breaking the project down into multiple steps, it clearly defines what the end goal is-for you and the client.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I've used wireframes in the past but had never worked with high fidelity wireframes. They are an excellent way to put together a final product in a simple and easy manner to allow for an easier breakdown of the project. Secondly, I enjoyed the cloning of a site, it shows how even fancy pages can be broken down simply.
