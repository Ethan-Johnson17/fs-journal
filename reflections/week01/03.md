## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

I like the ideas for border alternatives. I didn't think it made a big difference until I saw the various examples.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

The above link, the codeworks design requirements book: https://www.figma.com/proto/YfxDgdrescYyInvl5KBwT8/CodeWorks-Design-Requirements?node-id=272%3A7038&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=243%3A1&starting-point-node-id=273%3A2584, and I also have abook at home

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Design can convey mood, purpose, intended audience, professionality, and many other things. Because of that, if you have poor design, many of your intended audience will not be interested in your product.
