## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A psuedo class is only applied when a certain action is performed. Two that are common and I personally will be using often are :hover or :onclick. 

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is a number applied to selectors that determine which values will be applied over another. This allows you to use selectors with higher specificity to override an existing rule with a lower specificity. For example, I may need one heading to have a different color than other headings. I can change it with a higher specificity.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

It would be difficult to find errors relating to specificity or to use the beneficial side of specificity.
