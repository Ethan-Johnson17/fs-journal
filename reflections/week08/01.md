## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

It serves as a way to prove that you know what you are doing, it displays your strengths, creates a more personal "brand", and others.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

Apps and projects that you really care about. The topic isn't as important as the passion behind them.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

Tower, Inspire, PlanIt, and GameQ. These are projects that I feel I did well on and really enjoyed.
