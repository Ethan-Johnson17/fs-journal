## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Well, we've been experiencing this. Naming convention can be really difficult, especially when there's more than one person involved. Communication prevents a lot of coding errors.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

A small team can't reach the same standards of excellence as a large team in the same amount of time. The smaller team can also adjust and increase communication in order to reduce meetings, thereby saving time for the development of projects.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

Good and cheap but not fast, fast and cheap but not good, and good and fast but not cheap
