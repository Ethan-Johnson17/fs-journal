## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type holds a value within it's own memory space. Reference type points to where the value is stored. Pointer type includes a referent type and can be changed. 

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

Bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. These data types are like more specific versions of JS data types. They broke them down into more options.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

The address the reference points to is random and the address itsels is stored, whereas value type stores the value itself.
