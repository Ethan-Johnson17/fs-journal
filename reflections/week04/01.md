> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

A lot of ending brackets bunched up at the end of code is a sure sign. It's caused by the stacking of callbacks within each other. 

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

It refers to code that is not run immediately but saved for later. Callbacks are meant to push back the point where that code is ran.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

Keep code shallow: Don't nest functions within functions within functions. Name things appropriately.
Modularize: Break code into multiple files or libraries
Handle every error: expect and plan for errors
