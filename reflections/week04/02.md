## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending, failed and completed

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Promises can chain together callbacks rather than nesting them. It keeps the code cleaner and at a minimum.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

Catch is what happens when there's an error. Then is the actual promise.
