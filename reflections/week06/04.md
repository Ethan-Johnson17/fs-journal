## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

It's a route within a route, just like a nested element. It's a parent to child relationship.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

They will be fairly common, I suspect. They can be used when looking for a category wihtin a category, like if I was looking for a sports team on a website with multiple teams or sports.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes. An example might be if you're looking for an author's writings on a site of authors.
